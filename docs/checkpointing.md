# Checkpointing

This document describes how checkpoints are created, stored, loaded, and verified in Summit.

## Overview

Checkpoints enable nodes to sync from a recent state rather than replaying the entire chain from genesis. A checkpoint contains a snapshot of the consensus state at the end of an epoch, along with finalized headers that allow verification of the checkpoint's authenticity.

## Checkpoint Creation

Checkpoints are created at the **penultimate block of each epoch** (block `epoch * BLOCKS_PER_EPOCH + BLOCKS_PER_EPOCH - 2`). This timing ensures that:

1. All validator set changes (`added_validators`, `removed_validators`) are finalized before the epoch ends
2. The checkpoint hash can be included in the last block's header for verification

### Creation Flow

1. **Penultimate Block Processing** (`process_execution_requests`):
   - Buffered execution requests are processed: withdrawal requests are validated
     and enqueued, and deposits are drained from `deposit_queue` (up to
     `max_deposits_per_epoch`)
   - New validators are added to `added_validators` for the appropriate activation epoch
   - Validators exiting this epoch — voluntary full exits and minimum-stake removals
     (`enforce_minimum_stake`) — are added to `removed_validators`

2. **Checkpoint Creation** (`process_block`):
   ```
   if is_penultimate_block_of_epoch(epoch_num_of_blocks, height):
       checkpoint = Checkpoint::new(&state)
       state.pending_checkpoint = Some(checkpoint)
   ```

3. **Last Block of Epoch**:
   - The checkpoint hash is included in the block header's `checkpoint_hash` field
   - Validators sign this block, creating a quorum certificate over the checkpoint

### Checkpoint Contents

A checkpoint contains the serialized `ConsensusState`, which includes:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `epoch` | Current epoch number |
| `view` | Current view number |
| `latest_height` | Height of the last finalized block |
| `head_digest` | Digest of the last finalized block |
| `deposit_queue` | Pending deposit requests |
| `withdrawal_queue` | Pending payout queue (validator withdrawals and deposit refunds) |
| `validator_accounts` | All validator account states |
| `added_validators` | Validators scheduled to join, by activation epoch |
| `removed_validators` | Validators exiting at the current epoch boundary |
| `pending_execution_requests` | Deferred execution requests (e.g., withdrawals from last block) |
| `forkchoice` | Current forkchoice state (head, safe, finalized hashes) |

## Finalized Headers

Finalized headers are stored alongside checkpoints to enable verification. A `FinalizedHeader` contains:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `header` | The block header |
| `certificate` | BLS multi-signature from the validator committee |
| `signers` | Bitmap indicating which validators signed |

### Header Storage

Headers are stored when blocks are finalized:

```
if is_last_block_of_epoch(epoch_num_of_blocks, height):
    finalized_header = FinalizedHeader::new(header, certificate, signers)
    db.put_finalized_header(epoch, finalized_header)
```

Only the last header of each epoch is stored, as it contains:
- The `checkpoint_hash` referencing the checkpoint created at the penultimate block
- The `added_validators` and `removed_validators` for the epoch
- A quorum certificate proving consensus

## Checkpoint Loading

When a node starts, it attempts to load the most recent checkpoint:

### Loading Flow

1. **Find Latest Checkpoint**:
   ```
   latest_epoch = db.get_most_recent_checkpoint_epoch()
   checkpoint = db.get_checkpoint(latest_epoch)
   ```

2. **Restore Consensus State**:
   ```
   state = ConsensusState::try_from(checkpoint)
   ```

3. **Resume from Checkpoint**:
   - Set `sync_height` to `state.latest_height`
   - Set `sync_epoch` to `state.epoch`
   - Begin syncing from the next block

### Database Schema

Checkpoints and headers are stored in a single QMDB store using prefixed keys and explicit tracker entries for the latest stored epoch:

| Key Space | Key | Value |
|-----------|-----|-------|
| `checkpoint` | epoch (u64) | `(Checkpoint, last_block)` |
| `finalized_header` | epoch (u64) | `FinalizedHeader` bytes |
| `latest_checkpoint_epoch` | fixed state key | epoch (u64) |
| `latest_finalized_header_epoch` | fixed state key | epoch (u64) |
| `consensus_state` | epoch (u64) | `ConsensusState` bytes |

## Checkpoint Verification

Checkpoint verification allows a node to validate that a checkpoint is internally signed, contiguous from local genesis, fresh, and passes through an independently trusted weak-subjectivity anchor. The finalized-header chain by itself is not enough to bootstrap from an untrusted source: operators must supply a recent trusted finalized-header digest and epoch from outside the checkpoint bundle.

### Verification Scheme

To verify a checkpoint for epoch `n`, a verifier needs:

1. **Genesis state**: The initial validator set and their BLS public keys
2. **Finalized headers**: Headers for epochs `0` through `n`
3. **Checkpoint**: The checkpoint for epoch `n`
4. **Weak-subjectivity anchor**: A trusted finalized-header `epoch` and `digest` obtained independently of the checkpoint bundle

### Verification Steps

1. **Verify Header Chain**:
   - For each epoch `i` from `0` to `n`:
     - Verify the header links to the previous epoch header (or genesis for epoch `0`)
     - Verify the BLS multi-signature using the known validator set for epoch `i`
     - Extract `added_validators` and `removed_validators` from the header
     - Update the validator set for epoch `i+1`

2. **Verify Weak-Subjectivity Anchor**:
   - Check `finalized_headers[trusted_epoch].header.digest == trusted_digest`
   - Reject if the trusted epoch is not included in the supplied header chain
   - Reject if the terminal checkpoint epoch is more than 5 epochs after the trusted epoch

3. **Verify Checkpoint Hash**:
   - Compute the checkpoint digest
   - Verify it matches `checkpoint_hash` in header `n`

4. **Verify Validator Set Consistency**:
   - The checkpoint's `validator_accounts` should match the accumulated validator set changes

### Header Fields for Verification

Each header contains the validator set changes that take effect at the epoch boundary:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `added_validators` | List of `AddedValidator { node_key, consensus_key }` |
| `removed_validators` | List of validator public keys being removed |
| `checkpoint_hash` | Hash of the checkpoint (only in last block of epoch) |

The `consensus_key` (BLS public key) in `added_validators` allows verifiers to update their known validator set without needing the full checkpoint data for intermediate epochs.

> **Note:** Withdrawal requests received on the last block of an epoch are deferred to the next epoch to ensure `removed_validators` is accurate. See [Withdrawal Deferral at Epoch Boundaries](deposits-and-withdrawals.md#withdrawal-deferral-at-epoch-boundaries).

## Checkpoint Path (`--checkpoint-path`)

The `--checkpoint-path` flag specifies a path to load a checkpoint from when starting a node. It accepts either a single file or a directory.

### Single File

When the path points to a file, it is treated as an SSZ-encoded `Checkpoint`. The node loads the consensus state from it but cannot verify the checkpoint (no finalized headers are available). This mode requires trusting the checkpoint source.

```
--checkpoint-path ./checkpoint
```

### Directory

When the path points to a directory, the node expects the following structure:

```
checkpoint_dir/
├── checkpoint              # Required: SSZ-encoded Checkpoint
├── last_block              # Optional: SSZ-encoded last Block
├── finalized_header        # Optional: SSZ-encoded FinalizedHeader for the checkpoint epoch
└── finalized_headers/      # Optional: directory of epoch-indexed headers for verification
    ├── 0                   # SSZ-encoded FinalizedHeader for epoch 0
    ├── 1                   # SSZ-encoded FinalizedHeader for epoch 1
    ├── 2                   # ...
    └── n                   # SSZ-encoded FinalizedHeader for epoch n (the checkpoint epoch)
```

| File | Required | Description |
|------|----------|-------------|
| `checkpoint` | Yes | The SSZ-encoded checkpoint containing the serialized `ConsensusState` |
| `last_block` | No | The last finalized block, used to resume block processing |
| `finalized_header` | No | The finalized header for the checkpoint epoch |
| `finalized_headers/` | No | A directory of finalized headers indexed by epoch number (starting from `0`), used for trustless checkpoint verification |

### Checkpoint Verification on Startup

When the `finalized_headers/` directory is present, the node loads the checkpoint artifacts from disk first, then verifies the checkpoint during startup after loading genesis. Verified checkpoint imports require an independently configured weak-subjectivity anchor:

```
--checkpoint-path ./checkpoint_dir \
--weak-subjectivity-epoch 7421 \
--weak-subjectivity-header-digest 0x8f4c...
```

The header digest is the finalized header's `header.digest` for the trusted epoch. It can be queried from a trusted node with `getFinalizedHeaderDigest(epoch)`.

The checkpoint's terminal epoch must be within 5 epochs of `--weak-subjectivity-epoch`.

If the `finalized_headers/` directory is absent, verification is skipped and the node trusts the checkpoint as-is.

### `--checkpoint-or-default`

When set, the node falls back to starting from genesis if the checkpoint path does not exist, instead of panicking.
